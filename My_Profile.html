            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I am Taha! I was born in Australia during late 2003. My parents on the other hand are both from Lebanon, a small country off the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. I can speak English and Arabic. For fun I mostly go out with my friends or play games for fun, I do not really have any IT or programming background but I am still interested in learning, hence why I am doing the course I am. I graduated from Minaret College in 2021, so I am currently in my first year of university. I enjoy watching formula 1 and go karting every now and then. I am quite exited to be creating this website as it shall stand as a starting point for me to look back on, perhaps nearing my final years of university.

            <h2>Interest In IT</h2>
            <p>My interested for tech and anything related began at an early age, my father used to game quite often when I was young, this in turn exposed me to the world of gaming at around the age of 4. I used to play games such cs 1.6 and tomb raider. Me having 2 older brothers also influences my experience with tech, they would install routers, Lan and other related topics. My brothers also used to host servers on games such as maplestory, Garry's mod and Minecraft. This also intrigued me and made me want to learn more about the tech world. Perhaps seeing the variety of applications that tech had also intrigued me. My interest in IT is centred around programming and perhaps back end work, I am not to sure to be completely honest, my goal is to become exposed to enough aspects of IT which would allow me to better assess what I would like to further dive into. </p>

            <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
            <p>I chose to come to RMIT because I have heard from other RMIT and non RMIT students about how well the tech sector of RMIT is, a friend of mine even went as far as transferring from another well-established university to RMIT, completely because of the perceived higher quality of learning and materials. RMIT’s location is also of interest, as being in the city was a positive for me as we have an amazing city culture in Melbourne with lots of different restaurants and places to enjoy for when I am not studying. RMIT also seemed to be a bit more of a relaxed university as not having exams really reduces stress.  </p>

            <h2>Studying Expectations</h2>
            <p>My studying expectations are to learn more about server hosting and database storage, I would also enjoy learning things such as machine learning as it has many practical uses in not just daily life but also a working environment. Developing websites and apps is interesting so learning more HTML, CSS and JavaScript would be another aspect that I would like to venture into. By the end of my course, I will be able to independently develop and deploy full stack web applications. </p>

            <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56362901?type=standout#sol=8180bc6661ea010381ee48230e56171ff61e2b8d">Software Engineer at Morgan McKinley</a> 
            <p>The position of software engineer implies that there is more to the work than simply being a coder. Engineering requires thoughtful planning and strategy in decision making, in order to produce maintainable systems. I am attracted to the back-end nature of this role as it will provide me with the opportunity to explore writing business logic using typescript and node.js which I have not yet been exposed to. When people think of web development, its usually linked to web design and user interfaces, however I am interested in discovering and understanding how everything works ‘under the hood.’ </p>

            <h2>Result Discussion</h2>
            <p>These results do not really mean much, they are made to be quite general, and I usually take the results with a grain of salt. Although it is interesting and brings new insight into my behaviour and personality. Me scoring a 67% on the psychopath scale is not fully accurate as I would assume that most humans are erratic and most commonly act in their own interest. Comparing what I know about myself and the personality test results, there are a lot of clashes in certain cases. These results also allow me to make more accurate decisions in the types of behaviour I am partaking in, such as teamwork, best way to study certain topics and what my strengths and weaknesses are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box5">
            <h2>Team Impact</h2>
            <p>I think I do not need an online test to dictate how I will perform in a team environment as I know and understand my own capabilities, knowing that I am a ‘brainiac’ thinker may provoke me into taking on more sophisticated roles during team exercise. Feel as though working in a team environment knowing these results would not change my behaviour. </p>

            <h2>Taking Tests Into Account</h2>
            <p>Finding the perfect combination of personalities for a team could be possible as the test are somewhat accurate, such as including a leader, the brainiac, the designer etc. This will allow everyone to harness their abilities and combine it to produce the best piece of work possible from that group. Knowing that I am the apparent logical thinker in the group, may inspire me to take on more sophisticated roles in the group that I usually would not. </p>

        <div class="box7">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The project Is a smart phone app that allows new homeowners or house flippers to take photos of portions of the home that may need rebuilding/remodelling, the app will then give an estimate quote on the cost of renovation and recommend businesses that can complete the job. The app works to streamline the experience of renovating a home and allowing it to become less intimidating to new homeowners and more efficient for house flippers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box7">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>This project will be especially useful for new homeowners as according to ABS housing data, there were approximately 350,000 first home buyers in 2017-18. This will reduce the stress in some aspects of purchasing a home. This app can also assist in telling home buyers what the cost of renovation is prior to purchasing the property and showing areas that are more cost efficient to live in. Creating this into a smart phone as will allow the product to be low on cost and allow for mass distribution thus allowing for a more streamlined solution to the issue.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>With users being prompted to sign in as the application is launched, a database of information ranging from past quotes to payment information is saved, this will allow for a more personalised experience for the user as things such as colour of in-app programs may be changed. The application will make a link between the device's inbuilt camera and the application in order for images to be taken of areas in need of renovation. These images are then processed by built in image recognition and machine learning to identify areas in need of change/renovation. The processed images will then be fed into the database and further processed to provide an estimate quote for renovation. In times that the application is nonresponsive, bugs occur, or unique areas of renovation are unrecognised, users are able to input areas in need of renovation manually, this ensures users satisfaction is maximised. In order to generate the most accurate quote to users, industry averages on renovation jobs and the use of comparable properties that have undergone renovation are used in consideration with other factors to produce the most precise quote, as time progresses, the precision and accuracy of the quote will increase, as the incorporation of in-app learning allows for that. The use of a subscription base system allows for particular users who are interested in investment opportunities to have a better understanding of the prices of renovations for distinct suburbs and areas, this will therefore attract more users to the app for its financial gain. Users can also interact with businesses directly through the app which will allow for better communication via a messenger feature, this adds onto the feature of signing in as unique user numbers are generated for every member. These features is only accessible via the subscription service that the application provides. The application also shows areas that are ‘hot right now’ in the real estate market. As the application progresses and with the addition of further development, the applications features and uses will increase as the use of the app is incorporated into the real estate world. Specific partnerships may be made and thus exposing users of the application to discounts in certain fields such as the price for kitchen appliances or the price of tiling per square metre being reduced, this will act as an incentive for new users to join. The product will also price match certain partnered products which will allow for the lowest price possible for the users. </p>

            <h2>Tools Needed</h2>
            <p>A suitable ide/code editor will be required as well as an appropriate framework. This app image processing Api for the purpose of scanning and documenting damages through the device's camera. An authentication service for users that aims to securely manage account logins. A data base server will also be required that is cloud based. The construction of Api to assess calculate an estimate of the damages. A machine learning library and model will be required to be trained in order to accurately recognise damages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box9">
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- Programming skills in front end stacks </li>
                <li>- UX design is required for intuitive app flow </li>
                <li>- Programming skills in back-end stacks </li>
                <li>- Training machine learning models </li>
                <li>- Mobile apple development </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Realistically It is not plausible for me to acquire these skills within the next year however I have plans to progress my knowledge in all of these areas through my studies at RMIT. Since special hardware is not required and the listed technologies are extensively documented online for free and mostly open source, it is highly feasible to acquire these skills. </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The app being used regularly with renovation and real estate businesses incorporating our app into their line of work will depict a successful application. The issue of unknown cost of renovation will seize to exist for customers using the app and a more carefree renovation experience for new homeowners as the app will give a quick quote and connect users to renovation businesses that are used for the unique renovation. The app will also provide investment opportunities to those who otherwise would not be interested in that particular subject. </p>
